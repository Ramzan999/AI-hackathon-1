# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course - an immersive journey into the future of robotics where digital intelligence meets physical embodiment. This comprehensive program is designed to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and real-world robotic systems, focusing on creating robots that can perceive, reason, and act intelligently in complex environments.

## Course Overview

This course takes you through the complete stack of technologies required to build intelligent, embodied robotic systems. From the foundational ROS 2 framework that serves as the robot's nervous system, to advanced simulation environments, powerful AI processing with NVIDIA Isaac, and multimodal vision-language-action systems, you'll gain hands-on experience with the tools and techniques that are shaping the future of robotics.

The curriculum is structured around four core modules that build upon each other to create a comprehensive understanding of embodied intelligence:

1. **ROS 2 Nervous System** - The communication and coordination framework
2. **Simulation Environments** - Safe testing and development platforms
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Brain** - AI-powered perception and decision making
