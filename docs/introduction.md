# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive guide bridges the gap between digital AI systems and physical robotic platforms, focusing on embodied intelligence principles.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four main modules that progressively build your understanding of robotics systems:

1. **ROS 2 Nervous System** - Learn how ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems
2. **Simulation Environments** - Master Gazebo and Unity simulation platforms for safe development
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Brain** - Explore advanced perception and decision-making capabilities
4. **Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Understand multimodal AI integration for human-robot interaction

## Target Audience

This course is designed for AI developers who want to understand how to bridge their digital AI knowledge with physical robotic systems. Whether you're working with machine learning models, computer vision, or natural language processing, this course will show you how to apply these technologies in embodied robotic systems.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Interest in robotics and embodied intelligence

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement ROS 2-based robotic systems
- Create simulation environments for robot testing and development
- Integrate advanced AI capabilities using NVIDIA Isaac
- Build Vision-Language-Action systems for natural human-robot interaction
- Apply embodied intelligence principles in real-world robotic applications

## Course Structure

Each module contains:
- **Concepts** - Theoretical foundations
- **Hands-on Lab** - Practical exercises
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

Additionally, the course includes:
- A comprehensive capstone project integrating all concepts
- Reference documentation for APIs and tools
- Best practices and safety considerations

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide to set up your development environment, then proceeding through the modules in order. However, each module is designed to be self-contained for those who want to focus on specific areas.

The course emphasizes practical implementation with real examples, following the principle that intelligence emerges from the interaction between the robot's physical form, sensors, actuators, and environment.

## About This Book

This documentation is built using Docusaurus and is designed to be both a learning resource and a reference. All code examples follow PEP 8 standards and are compatible with ROS 2 Humble and Python 3.8+. Interactive components allow you to run code examples directly in your browser where possible.

The content reflects the "simulation-to-reality pipeline" approach, where concepts are first explored in simulation before considering real-world deployment, ensuring safety and efficiency in the learning process.
